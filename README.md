# Spam Detector using Machine Learning
This Git repository contains the code and files for our project, where we aim to build a spam detector using machine learning and launch it as a serverless API using AWS Elastic Beanstalk technology. The project consists of several tasks, each contributing to the development and deployment of the spam detector.
## Project Overview
The objective of this project is to create a robust and efficient spam detector by leveraging machine learning algorithms. We will build a Flask application and develop a RESTful API with GET/POST methods to handle spam detection requests. Additionally, we will train a machine learning model to accurately identify spam messages. The final deliverable will be a serverless API deployed on AWS Elastic Beanstalk, allowing seamless integration with other applications.

## Technologies Used
- Flask Python Framework: We will utilize Flask to develop the API for the spam detector, enabling seamless integration with AWS services.
- Machine Learning Methods: Basic machine learning algorithms will be employed to train the spam detector model, enabling accurate identification of spam messages.
- AWS Elastic Beanstalk: We will leverage the power of AWS Elastic Beanstalk to deploy the spam detector as a serverless API, ensuring scalability and high availability.
- AWS Desktop Management Console: The AWS desktop management console will be used to efficiently manage the deployment of the spam detector on AWS cloud servers.
- Version Control: Git will be used for version control, allowing you to easily switch between different versions of your web application and track changes.
- Project Structure

## The project is organized into the following sections:

* 1. Setup: Provides instructions on setting up the development environment, including the installation of necessary dependencies.
* 2. Data Preparation: Explains how to gather and preprocess the data required for training the spam detector model.
* 3. Model Training: Guides you through the process of training a machine learning model using the prepared data.
* 4. API Development: Shows how to create an API using Flask to expose the spam detector functionality.
* 5. Deployment: Demonstrates how to deploy the spam detector as a serverless API on AWS Elastic Beanstalk.
* 6. Version Control: Explains how to effectively utilize Git for version control and managing different versions of your web application.
* 7. Monitoring: Provides insights into monitoring AWS servers using the Elastic Beanstalk Desktop Management Console.
